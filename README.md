Hello my name is LaShelle Stewart. I've been doing data analysis since 2011 but had no clue it was career field until recently when one of my good friend's 
and mentors introduced me to the tech industry and specificially project management. I grow intrigued and begain interning as SalesForce Project Managment 
Coordinator while studying to be a Scrum Master until I stumbled upon data analytics and new it was a perfect fit for me! The common theme in all my 
prevopis roles has been my affinity and heavy reliance on Excel to create reports, collect and analyze data in order to inform business decisions. I'm now
taking my skillset to new levels by learning SQL, Tableau and R-Programming. I am looking for a job that I can use my current skill set while continuosly 
leanring and improving.

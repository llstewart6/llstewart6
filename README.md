Hello my name is LaShelle Stewart. I've been doing data analysis since 2011 but had no clue it was career field until recently. One of my good friend's and mentors introduced me to the tech industry and specificially project management. I grow intrigued and begain interning as SalesForce Project Managment Coordinator while studying to be a Scrum Master until I stumbled upon data analytics. The common theme in all my roles was my heavy affinity and reliance on Excel to create reports, collect and analyze data in order to inform business decisions. I'm now taking my skillset to new levels by learning SQL, Tableau and R-Programming. I am looking for a job that I can use my current skillet set while continuosly leanring and improving.
